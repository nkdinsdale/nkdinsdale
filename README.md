I am currently working as a post-doctoral research associate in the Oxford Machine Learning in NeuroImaging Lab (OMNI), working with Dr. Ana Namburete, in the Department of Computer Science. I studied for my DPhil (PhD) in the Analysis Group at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging at the University of Oxford, where I researched deep learning based approaches for neuroimaging analysis, supervised by Prof. Mark Jenkinson and Dr. Ana Namburete, funded by the UKRI EPRSC/MRC as part of the ONBI DTC.

My research uses computer vision and deep learning to solve medical imaging problems. I am especially interested in exploring methods to overcome the barriers to clinical translatability of deep learning methods and robust deep learning, and am open to collabortion opportunities.
